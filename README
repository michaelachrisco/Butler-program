This program will only work on the MAC OS at the moment. It will have more functionality later on. Currently working on:

1) Linux functionality
2) Google calendar integration

In the long term I would like to see:

1) Voice recognition
2) user friendly setup
3) GUI/web integration
4) room detection
5) phone sync and detection

MAC OS:
In order to make this program work, use:
chmod -x script_butler.sh
./script_butler

Windows (planning on testing in XP, Vista, 7)
